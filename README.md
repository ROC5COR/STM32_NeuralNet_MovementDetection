# STM32_NeuralNet_MovementDetection
Innovative project over neural networks and embedded systems

# Overview
This project aims at creating a Neural Network for STM32(L476RG) to do motion recognition with data from accelerometer. The neural net used is a multilayer perceptron and it has (currently) 3 layers. 

# Requirements
* STM32CubeMX : to edit project configuration (clock, gpios...)
* SystemWorkbench for STM32
* Accelerometer (ADXL345 used in this project)
* STM32 : STM32L476RG (Nucleo) used here

# Credits
Four motivated Esisar students
* Louka BARRIERE
* Gauthier CANET
* Romain LE DONGE
* Alexandre MORICEAU
